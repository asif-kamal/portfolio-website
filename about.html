  <h1>About Asif Kamal</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Asif Kamal and I am looking forward to embarking on the new career path of UX design and Front End development. I received my B.A. in Psychology from Temple University in Philadelphia. I was unsure of where to go next after graduation so I searched career options compatible with Psychology and found UX design to be compelling.</p>
  <p>I took the CareerFoundry course on UX design and the whole process very engaging. From learning what people want in an app, to creating prototypes, to designing with human psychology in mind it was exciting to learn so much in so little time. I am currently working on a portfolio website to show off my app prototype InkTank, and the different steps that I took to build it.</p>
  <p>I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and am looking for a company that values aesthetics, user-centered design, and creating solutions for everyday life. I am willing to make mistakes but also learn from them and become better. On this webiste you will see pieces of my work from my last project. If you have any questions or would like to know more feel free to contact me.</p>
